Constructor Functions

1. invoked with the "new" keyword
2. "this" refer to a new object
3. the default return value is "this"

function Employee(id, name, salary){
  if (this.constructor !== arguments.callee)
     return new Employee(id,name,salary);
  this.id = id;
  this.name = name;
  this.salary = salary;
}

Modify the above constructor function to exhibit the following behavior:

1. Convert all the members to accessors with the following validations
	a. id should be readonly
	b. name cannot be assigned an empty string
	c. salary cannot be assigned a value less than the current one
